# 🧠 Aikhan Jumashukurov

Hi, I’m Aikhan — a CS student at Princeton, a builder, and a curious mind with a love for clean design and powerful ideas.

This website is my minimalist digital home. It reflects what I value: simplicity, focus, and a little bit of glitchy chaos.

## 💡 Why This Page?

I wanted a landing page that felt like _me_ —  
not just another portfolio grid or résumé dump.

It’s simple. It’s dark. It glitches a little.  
It tells you who I am in under 10 seconds.
